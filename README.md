# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz - Project Keerbi Liu

## What is the purpose behind this procject?
<p>The code quiz allows me to design a fun project, whilst applying the knowledged gained from the javascript tutorials.</P>
<p>One good way of learning is to teach, and by creating your own questions, it also gives you an opportunity to look at a question from a new perspective and maybe learn something new.</P>
